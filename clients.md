## Examples

Due to its Api-First concept, Rokfor is agnostic towards clients.
Acually, you can feed in the data in whatever project you like:

- Multimedia installations built with openFrameworks
- Web app with Ionic
- Single page sites with angular
- Traditional server side rendering with PHP
- and many more

To help a little bit, there's hopefully a growing list of seed projects. They all connect to the rokfor
demo server.

## PHP

If you are more into server side rendering, you probably go with PHP. In most cases, this might 
be the easiest way to deploy on a regular webspace.

## JavaScript

There is a angular app which shows a very basic approach on how to get some data in a one page
app. If you prefer server side rendering or a mobile web app, this could be a way to go.
